# Webcrawler Description

Unfortunately, due to the nature of this project (UT class - Data Structures) I cannot post the code for this. However, this project took on two forms: first, parsing user text inut; second, using said parsed input to quickly filter through a set of HTML documents and find the relevant ones. Users were allowed to search for words seperately or as phrases, as well as to give prefernce to documents without certain words.

If you would like to here more about this project, feel free to contact me.

Best,

Logan
